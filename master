I HOPE everyone is well at this time!

 Hello People!!!
 
 On my free time I like to binge watchwatch as many movies or shows as I can. 

 I also love spicy food and I put the salsa that my mom makes all the time on everything that I eat.

During my free time I also enjoy Volunteering at the Homeless shelters and at the food banks. 

I also enjoy reading books about diffrent topics. For example I just finished reading Fahrenheit 451.
      
This took me quite a while to figure out but i hope I did all right.
